// File: out/test5/test5.ino
// Sample code generated by ss2em.py
//
This is just a test template not expected to be compiled in any programming language.
This is only intended to test the different capabilities of ss2em.py and to detect regressions when the code is modified
It will use the variables ALPHA, beta, Gamma for :::if statements
So, here we go:

 * Program arguments:
 * Path='public'
 * Output='out/test5'
 * Use='Test-template.txt'
 * Write=''
 * Include='all.h'
 * If='ALPHA,beta,VARIABLES'
 * Type='s'

Let do includes:
#include "all.h"
Line after the includes
