This is just a test template not expected to be compiled in any programming language.
This is only intended to test the different capabilities of ss2em.py and to detect regressions when the code is modified
It will use the variables ALPHA, beta, Gamma for :::if statements
So, here we go:

:::# This is a comment and should be ignored
 * Program arguments:
 * Path='[:::Path:::]'
 * Output='[:::Output:::]'
 * Use='[:::Use:::]'
 * Write='[:::Write:::]'
 * Include='[:::Include:::]'
 * If='[:::If:::]'
 * Type='[:::Type:::]'

Let do includes:
:::include
Line after the includes

:::if (ALPHA AND NOT DELTA) AND beta
Inside :::if (ALPHA AND NOT DELTA) AND beta
Now let try another :::if
:::if ALPHA
Inside :::if ALPHA
Let do a :::for
:::for
inside :::for loop  for: html path: [:::HtmlPath:::], name: [:::Name:::], mime: [:::MIME:::], and page: [:::Page:::]
let :::if again
:::if NOT delta OR Gamma
Inside :::if not delta OR Gamma
let do an :::if DELTA OR delta
:::if DELTA OR delta
Should not be here
:::fi
Now :::fi
:::fi
Let finish the :::for
:::end

Let try another :::for
:::for
Inside second for
let try an embedded :::for
:::for
Inside the embedded :::for
Let :::if with a file name (P404Html):
:::if P404Html

inside :::if P404Html([:::HtmlPath:::], [:::Name:::], [:::MIME:::], [:::Page:::])
:::fi
Let exit the embedded :::for
:::end

Still inside the first :::for
Now let exit it
:::end
End an :::fi
:::fi
End an :::fi
:::fi

End of File
